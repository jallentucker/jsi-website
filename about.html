<h1>About</h1>
<p>I graduated from the University of Florida in 2013 with a B.S. in Statistics. I am currently receiving training in <a href="http://www.portlandcodeschool.com">Portland Code School's</a> Javascript Immersion course in Portland, Oregon, in preparation to enter the software development industry. I previously worked for eight years as a technician specializing in <a href="http://www.esri.com">GIS</a> and statistical analysis at an environmental engineering and consulting firm in Gainesville, Florida.</p>

<h2>Personal Interests</h2>
<p>I spend most of my free time watching and reading about baseball, listening to music, or writing and recording music with friends. I received ten years of private classical piano training as a child and have gone on to play lead guitar in several rock bands. I formerly maintained a blog devoted to the University of Florida men's basketball team.</p>
